# Solution: Ages of Children

Every clue is actually helpful in this puzzle. Lets begin!

The first and second clues are the most useful. Right away, we can create a list of potential solutions:

* 1, 1, 36
* 1, 2, 18
* 1, 3, 12
* 1, 4, 9
* 1, 6, 6
* 2, 2, 9
* 2, 3, 6
* 3, 3, 4

What does the third clue tell us? Well lets sum our possible answers:

* 1 + 1 + 36 = 38
* 1 + 2 + 18 = 21
* 1 + 3 + 12 = 16
* 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
* 1 + 6 + 6 = 13
* 2 + 2 + 9 = 13
* 2 + 3 + 6 = 11
* 3 + 3 + 4 = 10

Since the mathematician has perfect memory, he remembers the address and matches it with one of the solutions above. However, he still doesnt know the answer. This means our list of possible solutions is restricted only to the ones where the sums have duplicates:

* 1 + 6 + 6 = 13
* 2 + 2 + 9 = 13

Now, the last clue mentioned the eldest child. Well only one of our 2 possible solutions has a single eldest child. Therefore, the solutions is:

2, 2, and 9.
