# Solution: Make 100

Notice that using any division operator would only create a fraction, unless some multiplication is used. Also, due to order of operations, using addition in order to use division would require paranteses. So first attempt to solve using only addition and subtraction.

I first noticed this:

67 - 89 = -22

And that: 

23-45 = -22

This left over the 1, and led me to realize the 1 can be used as the hundreds place for some combination, since -22+22 = 0.

 My final solution was:

 123 - 45 - 67 + 89 = 100
